# 📊 Task 6: Data Visualization – Retail Sales Analysis

## 📌 Internship Task
Data Analyst Internship – Task 6 focuses on using Python visualizations to analyze and interpret retail data.

---

## 📁 Dataset
**Retail Store Product Sales Dataset (retail.csv)**

The dataset includes numerical features such as:
- price
- discount
- promotion_intensity
- footfall
- ad_spend
- competitor_price
- stock_level
- weather_index
- customer_sentiment
- return_rate

## 📊 Visualizations Created

1. **Bar Chart**  
   Promotion Intensity vs Average Footfall  
   → Used to compare categorical impact on footfall

2. **Line Chart**  
   Footfall trend across records  
   → Used for trend analysis

3. **Histogram**  
   Distribution of return rate  
   → Used to identify skewness and outliers

4. **Scatter Plot**  
   Ad Spend vs Footfall  
   → Used to analyze correlation

5. **Highlighted Scatter Plot**  
   Highest footfall point highlighted for storytelling

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. Higher promotion intensity generally leads to increased customer footfall.
2. Advertising spend shows a positive relationship with footfall, indicating marketing effectiveness.
3. Return rates are mostly concentrated within a narrow range, with very few extreme values.
